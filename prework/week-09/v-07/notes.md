core 1 and core 2

processor1 reads the value
processor2 also reads the original value before processor1 has a chance to finish executing its instructions

the same computation is being ran again, one of the increases was actually lost during the programs execution

even a simple a computation with one integer can yield the wrong result

sharing between threads can be complication when we dont implement some kind of structure or order
